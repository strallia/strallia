## 🔭 What I'm Currently Working On

I'm currently contributing to One Community Global's open-source, MERN stack team management software. I review pull requests by testing code changes and resolving any side effects, helping to push code changes for the app's upcoming transition into phase II. I'm also focused on fixing bugs and developing a new component to display organizational metrics.


## Hobbies

- 🛼 Outdoor roller skating (nothing beats a sunset skate sesh 🌄)
